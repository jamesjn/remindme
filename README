Remindme is a simple application developed during the meetup.com battle of the braces 1-day hackathon.  It allows users to send email to an address to receive an sms text at a later time at a number that they specify.  It uses the SendGrid API (event sponsor) to receive emails and the Twilio (event sponsor) API to send sms.  It was built using python flask, using mongodb as the datastore and bootstrap for some style.
